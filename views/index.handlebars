    <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3 para">Give thanks to the most high. The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. Mogul talk. To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing. Mogul talk. You do know, you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch. I’m keeping it real with you, so what you going do is have lunch.</p>
    <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3 para">Lion! We don’t see them, we will never see them. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. Lion! The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key.</p>
    <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3 para">I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow. A major key, never panic. Don’t panic, when it gets crazy and rough, don’t panic, stay calm.</p>
